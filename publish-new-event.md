# What's Poller?

Poller is designed to periodically fetching data

* Catalog is to fetch fixed hardware information, such as serial number, FRU list. usually if there is no hardware configuration changes, these information keeps no changed.
* Poller is to fetch dynamically changed information, these data may change suddenly, such as hardware failure, power status.

# Poller Types

* IPMI poller
* SNMP poller
* Poller alert
* ARP cache poller

# Poller Special Design

* poller command parser

* depends on obm setting

  * A lot pollers run in out-of-band, they need the node's obm settings.
  * Heartbeat poller doesn't need obm
  * the credential can also be saved in poller config

* poller cache

  * Data is stored in memory rather than database
  * Default cache size=10, but can be configured in config.json via `pollerCacheSize`

* poller failure

  * If poll fails, the next poll interval will be automatically extended.

# Poller Implementation

Poller is implemented as endless job

![](/assets/normal-poll-sequence.png)

* Run WorkItem: [https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/run-work-items.js](https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/run-work-items.js)

Check whether the timer is out to poll, if so, publish the command to AMQP

* Command Job \(ipmi-job, snmp-job, redfish-job, poller-alert.job ...\):

[https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/ipmi-job.js](https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/ipmi-job.js)

[https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/redfish-job.js](https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/redfish-job.js)

[https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/snmp-job.js](https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/snmp-job.js)

Listen to the run command request, run specified poller command, parse command output, and output to AMQP

* Message Cache Job: [https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/message-cache-job.js](https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/message-cache-job.js)

Store the command result into poller cache

* Clean WorkItem: [https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/clean-work-items.js](https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/clean-work-items.js)

Periodically check whether a poller fails to poll during the schedulered time windows, if not, mark the poller as failed.

* Create Default Pollers: [https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/message-cache-job.js](https://github.com/RackHD/on-tasks/blob/master/lib/jobs/message-cache-job.js)

Create a list of poller workItems bases on the input poller configuration.

* Pollers Service Graph: [https://github.com/RackHD/on-taskgraph/blob/7fa4275fd2c704ced42413ead2479eee0f301af3/lib/graphs/poller-service-graph.js](https://github.com/RackHD/on-taskgraph/blob/7fa4275fd2c704ced42413ead2479eee0f301af3/lib/graphs/poller-service-graph.js)

}
```

## Publish Event Channels

* AMQP
  * Event can be published to AMQP, user listens to event by subscribing AMQP
  * Use [sniff.js](https://github.com/RackHD/on-tools/blob/master/dev_tools/sniff.js) to listen AMQP events
* Hook
  * A hook service: Http service which exports RESTful API to accept events
  * RackHD automatically pushes event to Hook server.

## Event Filter

User can subscribe interested events by defining a filter for event.

* AMQP filter by routing keys: [http://rackhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rackhd/event\_notification.html\#amqp-routing-key-filter](http://rackhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rackhd/event_notification.html#amqp-routing-key-filter)
* Hook has filter rules: [http://rackhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rackhd/event\_notification.html\#event-filter-rules](http://rackhd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rackhd/event_notification.html#event-filter-rules)

# Exercise

---

Introduce the event design.

**Goals:**

\(1\)Understand the common event format.

\(2\)Understand the event is sent via AMQP or Hook.

\(3\)Understand how to listen to the AMQP event via sniff.js.

\(4\)Understand how to operate the webhook.

**Practice:**

\(1\)Periodically generate 5 events in your customized job.

-All events should conform to the common event format.

-Make sure all events can be received by sniff.js.

-We will provide a webhook server, so you need to make sure your event can be received by webhook server.

**Extends:**

-Read the section about Event in readthedoc, understand how many events RackHD will send.
